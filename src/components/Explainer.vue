  <p class="mb-3">
    CreatorGuard is a free app for artists to protect their online portfolios
    from art theft.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Artist friends and colleagues have reported a dramatic increase in art theft
    from their online portfolios by scammers trying to cash in on the
    <abbr title="Non Fungible Tokens">NFT</abbr> craze with their stolen art.
    Watermarking art makes it more difficult to steal easier to prove ownership.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl">How does it work?</h2>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Select your artwork (PNG and JPG), adjust the watermark message
    (your portfolio address) and placement, then download a zip with all the
    processed images. Done.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl">Is it safe?</h2>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Yes. CreatorGuard is a client-only application meaning all the processing is
    done on your local device in your browser; Your work never leaves the device.
    Once loaded, the app can even work offline without an internet connection.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    The only data that gets transmitted from the site is analytics. This date is
    anonymous and is only used to measure how much traffic per day the app gets.
    These kinds of figures look good on my resume.
